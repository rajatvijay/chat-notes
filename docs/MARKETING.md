## 🎤 Speaker Notes & Demo Script

### 2-Minute Demo Script

**Opening** (15 seconds):
*"I'm going to show you how ChatNotes solves the biggest problem in note-taking: the friction between capture and organization."*

**Problem Setup** (30 seconds):
*"Here's what usually happens: You're in a meeting, someone mentions a deadline, you write 'Fix login bug due Friday' in whatever app is handy. Later, you can't find it, or it's buried in unorganized notes."*

**Solution Demo** (60 seconds):
*"With ChatNotes, I just type naturally: 'Fix the login bug due tomorrow for the client demo.' Watch what happens..."*

[Demo typing and automatic categorization]

*"Instantly categorized as a task, due date extracted and converted to the actual date, and the task content cleaned up. No folders, no tags, no decisions – just natural writing that becomes organized intelligence."*

**Closing** (15 seconds):
*"That's ChatNotes: your thoughts, automatically organized by AI. Simple enough for everyday use, smart enough to change how you think about note-taking."*

### Key Demo Moments
1. **Natural language input** – show typing in conversational style

4. **Search demonstration** – find the note instantly using various terms
5. **Cost transparency** – show the real-time cost tracking

### Handling Common Questions

**Q: "What if the AI categorizes something wrong?"**

**Q: "Is my data secure with AI processing?"**
A: "Absolutely. We use OpenAI's enterprise tier with data processing agreements, and you can see exactly what gets processed and when. Your notes never train their models, and you can export everything anytime."

**Q: "How much does the AI cost?"**
A: "Most users spend $2-3 per month on AI features. We show you exactly what each operation costs, so you're never surprised. It's like having a personal assistant that costs pennies per task."
